        <h2>
          Father Of Modern Electricity
        </h2>
        <p>
          <b>Tesla was born on 10 July 1856 in Smiljan, Austro-Hungarian Empire (modern-day Croatia), from a Serbian
            family.[3] Tesla's father, Milutin Tesla, was a priest in the Serbian Orthodox Church. His mother, Đuka
            Mandić, could useful household tools. Even she was a daughter of the Serbian Orthodox Church priest.
            Although very smart and with excellent memory, (she knew thousands of lines from "Gorski Vijenac" by Petar
            Petrovic Njegos) she had to take care of her siblings when her mother, Sofia Budisavljevic, died. Nikola
            Tesla's mother was a great influence on him. Both his parents were born in Lika, Croatia. He was the fourth
            child out of five. He had one older brother, Dane, who died when Tesla was 5, two older sisters, Angelina
            and Milka, and one younger sister, Marica.[4]

            Tesla, who loved science, was afraid that after his brother's accidental death he would have to continue the
            family tradition and become a priest. After he graduated from a prestigious High School in Karlovac,
            Croatia, he went back to Gospic during summer to see his family and almost died of cholera. He asked his
            father if he could go study engineering if by miracle he survived, and the father promised his dying son to
            send him to the best school in the whole world. Nikola's health improved quickly and his father sent him to
            study at the Technical College in Graz, Austria, in 1875

        <h2>Education and Early Career:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Technical University of Graz and later attended the University
            of Prague.
          </li>
          <li>
            He began his career working for telegraph and electrical power companies in Europe before immigrating to the
            United States in 1884.

        <h2>Transatlantic Odyssey:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In 1884, Tesla made a momentous decision to move to the United States, seeking opportunities and dreaming of
            working with the renowned Thomas Edison. However, their collaboration was short-lived, as Tesla's vision for
            alternating current (AC) systems diverged from Edison's preference for direct current (DC).

        <br>
        <h2>AC Triumph and Entrepreneurship:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Undeterred, Tesla pursued his vision for AC systems, securing numerous patents that laid the foundation for
            modern electrical power distribution. His inventions, including the induction motor and transformers,
            showcased his technical prowess. Tesla's entrepreneurial spirit led to the formation of the Tesla Electric
            Company, marking a new chapter in his career

          <h2>The War of Currents</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The "War of Currents" encapsulated a fierce rivalry between two titans of the electrical engineering world
              during the late 19th century: Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla. At the heart of the conflict were competing
              visions for the standardization of electrical power distribution. Edison, celebrated for his invention of
              the incandescent light bulb, championed direct current (DC), where electric charge flows continuously in
              one direction. On the other side stood Tesla, an inventive genius who advocated for alternating current
              (AC), a system featuring the periodic reversal of the charge's direction, proving more efficient for
              long-distance power transmission.
              <br>
              Edison, determined to assert the dominance of DC, embarked on a public relations battle. He highlighted
              safety concerns associated with AC's higher voltage and conducted controversial demonstrations, such as
              the notorious "electrical execution" events where animals were electrocuted using AC power. However, Tesla
              and his financial backer, George Westinghouse, countered with demonstrations showcasing the safety and
              efficiency of AC, dispelling Edison's efforts.
              <br>
              Ultimately, Tesla's AC system triumphed as the superior technology for transmitting electricity over
              extended distances. This victory laid the foundation for the widespread adoption of AC power distribution,
              powering the electrification of cities and establishing the modern power grids we rely on today. The "War
              of Currents" became a pivotal chapter in the history of electrical engineering, marking Tesla's legacy as
              a visionary whose innovations revolutionized the way we harness and distribute electrical power.

        <h2>Wardenclyffe and Wireless Dreams:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In his later years, Tesla envisioned a world connected by wireless communication. The ambitious Wardenclyffe
            Tower project aimed to create a global communication system. Despite financial challenges and the project's
            eventual halt, Tesla's ideas foreshadowed the wireless age we live in today

        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Legacy and Recognition:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Nikola Tesla's legacy extends far beyond his lifetime. His name is immortalized in the unit of magnetic flux
            density, the "tesla." His ideas paved the way for innovations in radio, radar, and modern electrical
            systems. Tesla's impact on technology, though not fully appreciated in his time, continues to resonate in
            the 21st century.
            <br>
            In retracing the biography of Nikola Tesla, we uncover the narrative of a visionary genius whose relentless
            pursuit of scientific discovery illuminated the world and laid the groundwork for the electrified future we
            inhabit today
